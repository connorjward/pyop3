# pyop3
A more powerful mesh traversal library.

## Developer notes
You can set pyop3 up to use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for linting with [black](https://github.com/psf/black) and import sorting with [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/index.html). To do so simply install `pre-commit` and then install the git hook scripts:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
